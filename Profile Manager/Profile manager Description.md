Profile mangaer
===

Create an add-in that allows the Inventor User to create settings "profiles".  These are akin to profiles from autocad.  This may be useful for users who are freelance inventor users who have to use the software to match client configurations.

* User configures Inventor as required.  This can include:  
	* Application Options
	* Project files???
	* current project file
	* iLogic Path directories
* User opens the profile switcher dialogue.
* User can create and activate a profile for the current setup.
* Changes the user makes will now save to that profile.
* The user can change profiles at any time, changing the set of Inventor configuration options.
